# currency-converter-in-java


Currency converter (or currency exchange) is a mini project coded in Java programming language. This simple application provides a web-based interface for exchanging/converting money from one currency (say $) to another currency (say €).

The complete source code of currency exchange application can be downloaded from the link below. As this is just a mini project, project report and documentation are not available. You can go through the description below for project abstract.

Currency Converter Project Abstract:
Different countries use different currency, and there is daily variation in these currencies relative to one another. Those who transfer money from one country to another (one currency to another) must be updated with the latest currency exchange rates in the market.

Currency converter mini project is built keeping this thing in mind. It is simply a calculator-like app developed using Ajax, Java servlets web features. In this application, there is regular update about currency of every country by which it displays present currency market value and conversion rate.

Such application can be used by any user, but it is mainly useful for business, shares, and finance related areas where money transfer and currency exchange takes place on a daily basis.

In this currency converter app, users are provided with an option to select the type of conversion, i.e. from “this” currency to “that” currency. This simple feature allows users to enter amount to be converted (say currency in Dollars), and display the converted amount (say currency in Euro).

If you're able to share a summary or specific details about the project, I can analyze and offer insights! Alternatively, you can list file names or core concepts, and I'll guide you based on that.


To provide meaningful insights about your **Currency Converter** project, let me walk you through common components such projects include. You can verify if any of these align with your project or share more specific details:  

### Typical Features in a Currency Converter Project
1. **Basic Functionality**:  
   - Converts one currency to another using exchange rates.
   - Supports multiple currencies like USD, EUR, GBP, INR, etc.

2. **Real-time Data Integration**:  
   - Fetches exchange rates dynamically using APIs like:
     - [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)
     - [Open Exchange Rates](https://openexchangerates.org/)
     - [Forex APIs](https://www.xe.com/).

3. **User Interface**:
   - **CLI (Command-Line Interface)**: Accepts inputs like source currency, target currency, and amount.
   - **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**: Built using tools like Tkinter, PyQt, or web frameworks.
   - **Web-Based**: Implemented using Flask, Django, or other web development frameworks.

4. **Backend Logic**:
   - Uses a language like Python, Java, or JavaScript to calculate converted amounts.
   - Implements validation for user inputs (e.g., valid currency codes, numeric amounts).

5. **Advanced Features**:
   - Displays conversion history or trends using charts.
   - Allows users to set alerts for specific exchange rate thresholds.
   - Includes offline functionality with static exchange rates.

6. **Files You Might Find**:
   - `main.py` or `app.py`: The primary script for functionality.
   - `requirements.txt`: Lists dependencies if using Python.
   - `index.html` or `style.css`: Frontend files for web-based projects.
   - `README.md`: Documentation with instructions on running the project.

### Key Questions to Understand Your Project
- **Technology Stack**: What languages or frameworks are used (Python, HTML, CSS, etc.)?
- **Core Features**: Does it handle real-time rates or static values?
- **Purpose**: Is this for personal use, academic purposes, or a professional portfolio?
